  <p> <center> I made my chef d'oeuvre using adobe express. I started by choosing the figures I wanted to represent my brain baby and then choosing the colors to accommodate them. I used figures from pieces of media I looked to indulge in because I wanted to share pieces of myself with the viewer. I included Martine Rose because I love her cuts and designs; I included the wolf because that is mon autoportrait. I think this image represents my aesthetic of success, hard work, stocks, and power. </center></p>

	<p> <center> I started this project by first mapping out his silhouette to get his shape. 
My thought process behind this was a French Tom Cruise wearing Walter About Rights. I imagine him as the antagonist in the game; a tycoon who wants to pollute the world for profit and your goal is to stop him. He dresses all nice and fancy to obstruct his impish demeanorâ€“the archetypal handsome devil. </center> </p>
