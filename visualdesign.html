  <p> <center> I made my chef d'oeuvre using adobe express. I started by choosing the figures I wanted to represent my brain baby and then choosing the colors to accommodate them. I used figures from pieces of media I looked to indulge in because I wanted to share pieces of myself with the viewer. I included Martine Rose because I love her cuts and designs; I included the wolf because that is mon autoportrait. I think this image represents my aesthetic of success, hard work, stocks, and power. </center></p>

	<br>
	
	<p> <center> I started this project by first mapping out his silhouette to get his shape. 
My thought process behind this was a French Tom Cruise wearing Walter About Rights. I imagine him as the antagonist in the game; a tycoon who wants to pollute the world for profit and your goal is to stop him. He dresses all nice and fancy to obstruct his impish demeanor–the archetypal handsome devil. </center> </p>

	<p> <center>  
I made my fourth chef d'oeuvre using photoshop and a lot of command J’s and E’s. I started out with some wolves (NOT foxes) and turned them pink and blue. I noticed as I copied and pasted the same pattern I began to see the mandala actually come to life. I felt really proud when I saw the finished product and saw that it actually came out nice!</center></p>

	<P> <center> I chose Choerry from Loona for my pop-art project! I decided to use Choerry because she’s one of my favorite members of one of my favorite bands. We used gradients and filters to get the pop-art effect digitally. We also used swatches to color in our subject to enhance that pop-art feel. I’m so happy with how it turned out considering I was kind of stressing during the coloring in process.</center> </P>

	<h3> <center> Fantastical Beasts</center></h3>
	<img src = "VIsual Design media/Nyancat.png" class = "center" width ="630" height = "580" />
	<p> <center> I chose a maine coon, vulture, and hawk; these animals were carefully picked to represent my person. My animals abilities consist of flying, hissing, and coughing up hairballs. I decided these abilities based on how it looked; it has wings and has a cat mouth. I turned my animal into a hybrid by removing the cat's hind-paws and applying the vulture claws and hawks wings. If I saw my hybrid I would likely start a campaign to hunt it to extinction.

	<h3> <center> Activism Collage</center></h3>
	<img src = "VIsual Design media/BOOMBOOM.png" class = "center" width = "400" height = "400" />
	<p> <center> My social justice topic was commodification. I chose commodification because I am strongly against the vapid consumerism emerging in our society incentivizing the bourgeoisie to monetize the human essence even more in an attempt to churn out products. I think viewers should understand how commodification has led many to struggle as aspects of life are taken from them and turned into a product you can buy at the store for 5.99. I chose to juxtapose images of homes being sold and water being put into bottles with thirsty children and homeless people to reinforce this message that commodification creates needless struggle. </center></p>
